# The Villager Rebuild

A mobile-first 3D survival and settlement-building game.

The player always controls one main Ranger. The game begins with a shipwreck and hands-on survival, then gradually develops into a small living settlement where recruited villagers automate gathering, hunting, construction and production while the player continues to explore, build and manage the village.

## Core fantasy

Survive alone -> establish a home base -> recruit survivors -> give them homes and permanent jobs -> automate repetitive work -> develop food and production -> grow a camp into a village, town and eventually a fantasy island city.

## Current milestone

**Foundation 0.1 — boot, terrain and mobile-control test**

This milestone deliberately tests only the stable technical base:

- pinned local Three.js dependency bundled by Vite;
- small explicit boot path with visible startup errors;
- continuous generated island terrain rather than visible terrain tiles;
- third-person movement/camera with a temporary procedural Ranger placeholder;
- mobile joystick, sprint and jump controls;
- optional HUD loaded only after the world starts;
- clean-build verification in GitHub Actions.

The selected KayKit Ranger, animation rigs and environment GLBs are the next isolated integration step after this base build passes CI. Asset loading is intentionally kept separate from boot/input architecture so a model-format problem cannot prevent the core game from starting.

## Project principles

- `main` must remain a playable/stable build once gameplay development begins.
- The repository documentation is the source of truth for agreed design and architecture.
- Gameplay, UI, assets, AI, persistence and deployment must remain modular.
- Shared gameplay data should be data-driven rather than duplicated in feature code.
- Mobile performance and readable touch controls are first-class requirements.
- New systems should expand existing world rules rather than creating separate player/NPC versions of the same mechanic.
- Asset packs must be audited before integration.
